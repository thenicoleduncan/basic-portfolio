        <p>Hey visitors! Welcome to my online home. My name is Nicole Duncan and I am an aspiring web developer. I am
            currently attending the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp for Continuing and Professional Education. I
            spent two years at Mesa Community College trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. After
            witching majors four times, I decided to do more research into the web design and coding world. I ended up
            running into this coding program by happen stance and decidied to quit school and give this a go. It's been
            the best decision I have ever made! </p>
        <p>I would encourage everyone to follow their dreams and to never settle for less. We all havesomething that we
            are gppd at and are meant to do. So do it!</p>
